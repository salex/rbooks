      h5.strong About Banking
      p.my-1.5 Banking is a semi-optional feature. If you do not reconcile your bank statements with your account in some fashion, you can skip this section. You might want to look at the Checking Balances area. If you do, there is a Bank Statement feature. Optionally, if your bank's on-line banking has a feature to download transaction using OFX (QuickBooks), there is a Bank Transactions feature.
      p.my-1.5 By default, RCash assumes you Checking account name is <strong>Checking</strong>. You can set your account name (and ID) using a link on the Bank Statements index/list.
