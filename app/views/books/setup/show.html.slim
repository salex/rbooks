      div All Trees must include:
      ul
        li A ROOT account
        li Branches which must include the basic accounting equation account type of [ASSET, LIABILITY, EQUITY, INCOME, EXPENSE]. These branches are at level 1.
        li Leaves/Leafs - These are the end point of a branch where Entries (transactions) are entered. If a branch has not leafs (children) it is considered a leaf.
      div After level 1 accounts, there are some options
      ul
        li ASSET accounts may have branches that include Account types of BANK or CASH. BANK accounts usually means that there is a Bank Account statement that should have a Reconcile process.These accounts are typically placed in a Current Assets branch
        li LIABILITY accounts may have braches that include an account type of CREDIT. Again a statement usually comes into play.
